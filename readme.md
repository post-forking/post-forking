WordPress Post Forking allows users to "fork" or create an alternate version of content to foster a more collaborative approach to WordPress content curation.

## Description ##

WordPress Post Forking allows users to "fork" or create an alternate version of content to foster a more collaborative approach to WordPress content curation. This can be used, for example, to allow external users (such as visitors to your site) or internal users (such as other authors) with the ability to submit proposed revisions. It can even be used on smaller or single-author sites to enable post authors to edit published posts without their changes appearing immediately. If you're familiar with Git, or other decentralized version control systems, you're already familiar with WordPress post forking.

### How might you use it? ###

* Allowing users without edit or publish post capabilities to edit and submit changes to content (similar to [GitHub’s pull request system](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests))
* Collaborative editing (by resolving two users’ conflicted saves – [Wired’s example](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/02/github-revisited/))
* Saving draft changes of already-published content
* Scheduling pending changes to already-published content

### How does it work? ###

When a user without the `edit_post` capability attempts to edit a given post, WordPress will automatically create a "fork" or alternate version of the post which they can freely edit. The edit screen will look just like the standard post editing interface that they are used to. When they're done, they simply click "submit for review." At this point, the fork goes into the standard WordPress moderation queue (just like any time an author without the `publish_post` capability submits a post), where an editor can review, and potentially approve the changes for publishing. If the changes can be automatically merged, the original post will be updated, otherwise, the editor will be presented with the ability to resolve the conflicting changes. All this is done using WordPress's built-in custom post type, revision, and diff functionality, so it should look familiar to most WordPress users.

### Concepts ###

WordPress Post Forking introduces many of Git's well-established conventions to the WordPress world, and as a result, uses a unique vocabulary to describe what it does:

* **Post** - Any WordPress post that uses the `post_content` field, including posts, pages, and custom post types
* **Fork** - Clone of a post intended for editing without disturbing the parent post
* **Branch** - Parallel versions of the same parent post, owned by the post author
* **Merge** - To push a fork's changes back into its parent post
* **Conflict** - When a post is forked if a given line is changed on the fork, and that same line is subsequently edited on the parent post prior to the merge, the post cannot be automatically merged, and the conflict is presented to the merger to resolve

## Under The Hood ##

** **Warning: geek content!** **

Forking a post creates a copy of the most recent version of the post as a "fork" custom post type. Certain fields (e.g., `post_content`, `post_title`) are copied over to the new fork. The plugin also stores the revision ID for the revision prior to when the fork was created (see [`includes/revisions.php`](https://github.com/benbalter/post-forking/blob/master/includes/revisions.php#L2) for more information as to why we store the previous revision).

The fork post type has its own capabilities, allowing a user without the ability to edit or publish on the parent post to edit a fork. Once changes have been made, assuming the user does not have the `publish_fork` capability, the user would submit the fork for review (similar to submitting a Pull Request in GitHub parlance) using the normal WordPress moderation system.

Publishing a fork (either by the fork author, if they have the capability, or by an editor) triggers the merge itself. The post content of the fork undergoes a three way merge with the base revision and current version of the parent post.

A fork can have three post statuses:

1. Draft - The fork is being edited
1. Pending - The fork has been submitted for publication
1. Published - The fork has been merged

Note: No user should have the `edit_published_fork` capability. Once published, the fork post_type simply exists to provide a record of the change and allow the author page, to theoretically list contributions by author.
